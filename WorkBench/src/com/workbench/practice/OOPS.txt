Inheritance

Inheritance is used to reuse the fields that are used in main class. That means super class fields can be used in subclass
It is also used to override the methods.
It is used to achieve code reusability.
For example you have class A and Class B extends class A. if we create one object B we can access both the variables defined
in both the classes that is called code reusability.

Types
Single(Class B extends A)
Multilevel(Class B extends A, Class C extends B)
Hierarchical
Multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
