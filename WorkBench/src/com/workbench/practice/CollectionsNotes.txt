-->Collections interface is the most important concept in Java it will help programmer to manipulate the Data
	Collection has Root interface with the basic methods like add(), remove(), addAll(), removeAll(), contains(), isEmpty()...etc

	There are Three Major type
	1)List
	2)Set
	3)Map

LIST-->It can contain Duplicate values and elements are ordered.
	   Implementations are LinkedList, ArrayList

SET-->Doesn't allow Duplicates
		Implementations are HashSet, TreeSet(Treeset maintains sorted order)

MAP-->Doesn't allow duplicates. Contain key value pairs.
		Implementations are HashMap TreeMap(TreeMap Implements sorted order)
		
		Major Differencce between Set List and Map
		
Duplicate:: List allows duplicates and Set will not allow duplicates. 
			While map hold two entry for object key and values.
			Values may contain duplicate but keys are always unique.	
			
Order:: List maintains the order. While Set will not maintain any order.
		LinkedHashSet, TreeSet maintains the order, imposed by comparator or comparable

Null:: List allows many null elements. Where Set can have only one null element.
	   In map you can have null values but atmost u can have only one null key.
	   
	   When to use SET LIST and MAP
	   
--> If you want to access the elements frequently List is way to go.
-->If you want to store the elements and want them to maintain order the u can use Set.
-->If you don't want any duplicate elements use Set.
