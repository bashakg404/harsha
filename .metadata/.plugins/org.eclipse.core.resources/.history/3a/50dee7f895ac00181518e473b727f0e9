STRING

-->String is built in and final class.

-->Two ways to create String objects
	1. Without using new operator.
	2. Using new operator.

--> If you create String without new operator, the string will be in String Constant Pool. JVM verifies String literal in the String
	Constant Pool.
	If String literal is not available in the pool it will create new String object inside the pool.
	If available then existing String object address will be assigned to String reference variable

--> System.out.println(s1==s2);----It will compare the address(Hashcode)
	System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));-----It will compare the value inside the object.
	
--> Intern is key word which will create the string in constant string pool. If the string literal is same it will point to that
	else it will create one more object in String Constant pool.
	
POLYMORPHISM

-->Polymorphism is concept of java where we can perform single action in different ways.

-->Two Types 1. Compile time(Method overloading)
			 2. Run time(Method Overriding)

** When we make class as a final?
--> To prevent inheritance.
--> A final class is simply a class which cant be extended/instantiated/subclassed.
--> This is done for reasons of security and efficiency.

** How can you convert String as an integer

Ex: String str="12345";
	int num=Integer.parseInt(str);
	
	Same for all other data types.

Encapsulation

--> Binding the data with the code that manipulates it.
--> It keeps the data and the code safe from external interference.
